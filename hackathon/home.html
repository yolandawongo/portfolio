           <p> Take DC power from the solar panels and invert it to AC power that is usable in your home,<br>
            and it can take AC power from the grid and use it to store DC energy in your batteries. <br>
            Although hybrid solar inverters are designed to work with batteries, they can also operate without them. 
           <br> If you’re not using a battery with your hybrid inverter, <br> the unit will simply divert any excess solar power it generates
             into the grid instead. <BR></p>Hybrid solar inverters are more efficient than traditional inverters,<br> 
                and they’re also significantly more versatile. They can be used with a variety of different battery <br> 
                storage systems,  making them a good choice for anyone who wants to make full use of solar power generation.

                <img src="images/off-grid inverter.png" alt="off-grid inverter">
                <p> Off-grid inverters are designed to work alone and cannot synchronise with the grid. <br> They connect to the property in place of grid power and cannot work in conjunction with it.

                  <br>  Off grid inverters must supply power from DC to AC instantly to power the appliances. <br> It must react quickly and up to and over the capacity rating of the inverter. <br> It draws power from the battery, converts it from DC and outputs AC.</p>

             <p> GRID operate without batteries. No need for a battery bank. <br> PV Solar powers your load directly during the day while mains power supplies <br> the loads at night or during periods of insufficient sunshine. <br> Excess solar power can be fed into the grid.</p>
